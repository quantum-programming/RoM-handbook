## cnpy

We used [cnpy](https://github.com/rogersce/cnpy),
which is a C++ library for reading and writing the
[NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) data format.

The source file is `cnpy.cpp` and the header file is `cnpy.h`,
both of which are copied from
[the repository](https://github.com/rogersce/cnpy)
and included in `fast_dot_products.cpp`.

This library is MIT licensed.
